== Spelling == 
"is there a way to change the way it says a name? For instance, if that someone special is calling, can it say "Your sweetie is calling" or someone u don't like have it say "Moron"? Anyway, I think u get the question. For me inparticular, its miss pronouncing my daughters name, which is spelled weird."

== Contact Chooser enhancement == 
"I think that having an "ungrouped" group selection would be quite handy...I've added some contacts via the android system, and never added them to a group, now I don't remember who I added.

Something else handy would be if the listing of all contacts showed what groups each one belonged to."
