How to fix some of your problems.


= Details =

Most problems are because of not working [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS].
Before doing a lot of work trying to fix that, start TTS Preferences (linked in my app) and see if there is something like "wait while downloading voice-data".
If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads voice data (only 2MB).
Then try my app again (using the test in SayMyName).

If these steps didnÂ´t help you, contact me or read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]

I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
