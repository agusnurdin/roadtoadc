*Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!*

If not:
 * *Turn your phone´s volume up!*
 * *Press "TTS" in my app and try the TTS-Test there*
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesn´t work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]
 * Or contact me and describe your problem!

It seems like you have a Motorola Droid (Android 2.0). Try "SayMyName Eclair" from the Android Market. If you use it already, try "SayMyName Donut". If nothing works, report an issue [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20from%20user here].


Thanks a lot for every feedback I get!
I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
