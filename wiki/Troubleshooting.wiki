Four points to fix your problems.


= Details =

Most problems are because of not working [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS].


 * Before doing a lot of work trying to fix that, start TTS Preferences (linked in my app) and see if there is something like "wait while downloading voice-data". If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads voice data (only 2MB).

 * Maybe you used another app using TTS. In version 2.0 of SayMyName, there is a bug. You have to restart SayMyName completely (e.g. with rebooting your phone or killing SayMyName using a task-manager (only for advanced-users!)). This will be fixed in the next update.

 * TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]

 * If point 3 is too long for you, please contact me and describe your problem!


Thanks a lot for every feedback!
I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
