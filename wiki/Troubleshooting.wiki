Please see if there's an update available at the Android Market before you report a problem.

If there's no update or it doesn't fix your problem, [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/entry file a bug] or send me a mail.

*Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!*

If not:
 * *Turn your phone´s volume up!*
 * Press "TTS" in my app and try the TTS-Test there
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesn´t work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]
 * *Or contact me and describe your problem.*


Thanks a lot for every feedback I get!
I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
