*Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!*

If not:
 * *Turn your phone´s volume up!*
 * *Press "TTS" in my app and try the TTS-Test there*
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesn´t work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]
 * Or contact me and describe your problem!
