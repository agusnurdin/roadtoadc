Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!

If not:
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesnÂ´t work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]
