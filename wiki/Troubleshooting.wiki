Please see if there's an update available at the Android Market before you report a problem.

If there's no update or it doesn't fix your problem, [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/entry file a bug] or send me a mail.

*Or maybe you use the wrong version? [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/wiki/Download Please read this page.]

= It only says "unknown" =

Search the Android Market for "SayMyName Dessert", install it and uninstall old "SayMyName". It should work now.
If you can't find "SayMyName Dessert" in Android Market, your phone is too old. You can send me a mail, maybe I can find the problem.

= "It doesn´t speak" =

*Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!*

If not:
 * *Turn your phone´s volume up!*
 * Press "TTS" in my app and try the TTS-Test there
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesn´t work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]
 * *Or contact me and describe your problem.*


Thanks a lot for every feedback I get!
I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
