Please follow [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/wiki/ForceClose these steps] and send me the log.

*Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!*

If not:
 * turn up your ringer's volume. Maybe it's just too quiet for you.
 * open SayMyName. It will tell you if TTS isn't installed, or there are some files missing.

 * restart your phone. Sometimes there's something completely wrong, until you restart your phone.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/wiki/ForceClose follow these steps] and send me the log.

 * go to "Speech settings" in SayMyName and try the TTS-Test there
 * If you installed [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/ TTS] for the first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

 * Test doesn't work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting Troubleshooting TTS]

If there's no update and none of the steps above fixed your problem, [http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/entry file a bug] or send me a mail.


Thanks a lot for your feedback. I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
